# My-Task-Board
In this full-stack challenge, I  developed a straightforward task management application, which will involve implementing essential HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. 

# The board is saved/updated when users make the changes.
# Anyone can access the board with a unique ID, eg: example.io/my-board-id.
